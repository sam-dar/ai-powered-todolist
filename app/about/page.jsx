            Our Task Manager makes organizing your tasks a breeze. Effortlessly
            add, delete, or update the status of each task to mark it as &quot;done&quot; or
            &quot;todo&quot; â€” all from a single, intuitive platform.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            But that&apos;s not all: with Copilot&apos;s intelligent assistance, you can
            manage tasks using simple, natural language. Need to add tasks for the
            week? Just ask! For example, say &quot;Add tasks for seven days of the week
            to make dinner, one for each day,&quot; and watch as Copilot creates
            separate tasks for each day. 
          </p>

            Want to tidy up your list? Use prompts like &quot;Delete task (ID)&quot; to
            remove specific tasks instantly. With these AI-powered features, you
            can enjoy a more organized, efficient approach to managing your daily
            tasks.
